                      <strong>Definition:</strong> The Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings ratio (CAPE), also known as
                      the Shiller P/E, measures the price of the S&P 500 relative to its inflation-adjusted average
                      earnings over the past 10 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Purpose:</strong> By using a 10-year average of earnings, the Shiller P/E smooths out
                      short-term fluctuations in corporate profits caused by business cycles, providing a more stable
                      valuation metric than the traditional P/E ratio.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Interpretation:</strong> A high Shiller P/E (above historical average of ~16.9) suggests
                      the market may be overvalued, while a low ratio suggests potential undervaluation. The metric has
                      been a reliable predictor of long-term (10+ year) market returns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Limitations:</strong> Critics note that accounting standards have changed over time, and
                      the 10-year window may not always be appropriate. The metric also doesn't account for changes in
                      interest rates, which affect fair valuations.

                      <strong>Definition:</strong> The Fear & Greed Index is a composite indicator that measures
                      investor sentiment using multiple market metrics, including volatility, put/call ratios, market
                      momentum, and junk bond demand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Purpose:</strong> The index aims to quantify market psychology, based on the premise that
                      extreme fear often represents buying opportunities, while extreme greed suggests markets may be
                      due for a correction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Interpretation:</strong> The index ranges from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed),
                      with values below 25 indicating extreme fear and values above 75 indicating extreme greed.

                        The Fear & Greed Index is most valuable as a contrarian indicator at extremes. When the index
                        shows "Extreme Fear," markets have often been near bottoms. Conversely, "Extreme Greed" has
                        often preceded corrections.

                      <strong>Definition:</strong> Sentiment analysis uses natural language processing and machine

                      social media, news articles, and forum posts.

                      <strong>Purpose:</strong> In financial markets, sentiment analysis quantifies investor mood and
                      opinion, which can influence market movements independent of fundamental factors.

                      <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Sentiment scores typically range from 0-100, with higher numbers
                      indicating more positive sentiment. Extreme readings or rapid changes in sentiment can signal
                      potential market turning points.

                        theory often ignores. It can identify periods when markets are driven more by psychology than
                        fundamentals, potentially creating mispricing opportunities.

                      <strong>Definition:</strong> Correlation analysis measures the statistical relationship between
                      two variables, such as sentiment indicators and market returns, or between different asset
                      classes.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Purpose:</strong> In behavioral finance, correlation analysis helps identify relationships
                      between psychological factors and market movements, potentially revealing causal connections or
                      predictive patterns.

                      <strong>Measurement:</strong> Correlation is typically measured using the Pearson correlation
                      coefficient (r), which ranges from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to +1 (perfect positive
                      correlation), with 0 indicating no correlation.

                        Correlation does not imply causation. A strong correlation between sentiment and market
                        movements doesn't necessarily mean one causes the other. Additionally, correlations can change
                        over time, especially during market stress periods when many assets become more correlated.

                  <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1">
                    The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered (the "anchor"). In
                    investing, this often manifests as anchoring to purchase prices or recent highs/lows when making

                    The tendency to overweight information that comes readily to mind. Investors often give too much
                    importance to recent, dramatic, or personally experienced events when assessing probabilities.

                    The tendency to search for, interpret, and recall information that confirms one's pre-existing
                    beliefs. Investors often seek out information that supports their investment thesis while ignoring

                    The tendency of individuals to mimic the actions of a larger group. In markets, this leads to

                    The tendency to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains. Research shows that the pain
                    of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining, leading to
                    risk-averse behavior.

                    The tendency to overestimate one's knowledge, abilities, and the precision of one's forecasts. In

                    The tendency to place greater importance on recent events and extrapolate recent trends into the

                    The tendency to sell winning investments too early to lock in gains and hold losing investments too

                    The tendency to create explanatory stories that connect unrelated facts and random events. In
